BetBot
======

A python bot using Selenium and BeautifulSoup that places bets on virtual football matches on www.bet365.com following a scheme similar to the ladder bet. The bot also crawls statistics for the same games, and makes a summary. From there, however, one can see that the scheme is, unfortunately, not able to work as intended.
